#TODO Fix the stupid input error through the quad mesh, that doesn't happen in the MainUI scene >:(

Implemented OSWindow class, with resizing, moving around, and a modular system to make different programs that load within windows. This is loaded on a Camera3D on a quad mesh with a subviewport texture in order to allow a 3d macintosh to exist in the 3d world and the scrreen to load the ui.
